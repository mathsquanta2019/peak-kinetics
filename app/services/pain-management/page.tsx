      title: "Manual Therapy",
      description:
        "This involves skilled, hands-on techniques performed by your therapist, such as joint manipulation, soft tissue mobilization, myofascial release, and gentle joint traction. It is designed to relax tense muscles, improve circulation, and desensitize painful areas.",
      why: 'When you are in pain, your muscles often tighten up as a protective mechanism, which can actually make the pain worse. Manual therapy helps break this "pain-spasm" cycle, providing immediate relief and making it easier for you to move without guarding or hesitation.',
    },
    {
      title: "Therapeutic Exercise",
      description:
        '"Motion is lotion." We prescribe specific, low-impact movements and graded exercises that are safe for your current pain levels. We start slowly and gradually build up your tolerance, focusing on flexibility, stability, and gentle strengthening.',
      why: "Chronic pain often leads to fear of movement, which causes weakness and stiffness. Controlled exercise flushes fresh oxygen and nutrients to injured tissues and stimulates the release of endorphins—your body's natural painkillers. It builds the physical resilience needed to handle daily activities without flaring up.",
    },
    {
      title: "Education & Prevention",
      description:
        'We believe that understanding your pain is the first step to conquering it. We teach you about "pain science"—how your nerves process signals—and provide practical advice on posture, ergonomics, and pacing your daily activities to avoid doing too much, too soon.',
      why: "Pain does not always equal harm. By understanding your triggers and learning how to move smartly, you regain a sense of control. This empowers you to make lifestyle changes that prevent flare-ups and reduces the anxiety often associated with chronic conditions.",
    },
    {
      title: "Modalities",
      description:
        "We utilize evidence-based technologies as helpful adjuncts to your treatment. This may include electrical stimulation (TENS/NMES) to block pain signals, ultrasound for deep heating, or cryotherapy/heat therapy to manage inflammation and stiffness.",
      why: 'These tools provide a "window of relief." While they don\'t fix the root cause on their own, they are excellent for dampening acute pain signals and reducing inflammation. This makes the active parts of your therapy—like stretching and strengthening—more comfortable and effective.',
