      title: "Joint Mobilization",
      description:
        'This is a skilled, hands-on technique where your therapist uses gentle, precise movements to glide and stretch your joints. Unlike a high-velocity "crack," this is a controlled and comfortable method to "un-stick" a stiff or painful joint.',
      why: "Stiff joints are often painful and are a primary cause of limited movement. By safely restoring your joint's natural motion, we can immediately decrease pain, reduce muscle guarding, and improve your flexibility. This makes it easier and more comfortable to bend, reach, walk, and twist.",
    },
    {
      title: "Strength Training",
      description:
        "This is not your typical gym workout. This is a highly specific, customized exercise program designed to strengthen the exact muscles that support your injured area or weak joints. We focus on correcting muscular imbalances and improving your body's stability.",
      why: "Strong muscles are your body's natural brace and shock absorber. They protect your joints, reduce the strain on painful tissues (like tendons or cartilage), and provide long-term stability. This is the most effective way to create lasting pain relief and prevent the injury from returning.",
    },
    {
      title: "Pain Management",
      description:
        "Our first priority is to break the pain cycle. We use a variety of strategies—including gentle hands-on techniques, education on activity modification, and specific, safe exercises—to calm down irritated nerves and tissues and provide immediate relief.",
      why: "You can't heal effectively if you're in constant pain. By managing your symptoms, we create a \"window of opportunity\" for your body to heal. This also allows you to comfortably participate in the strength and mobility exercises needed to fix the underlying problem for good.",
    },
    {
      title: "Surgical Recovery",
      description:
        "Rehabilitation after an operation (like a joint replacement, rotator cuff repair, or ACL reconstruction) is just as important as the surgery itself. We work closely with your surgeon to create a structured, step-by-step plan to guide your recovery.",
      why: "The surgery fixes the structure; the therapy restores your function. We are experts at helping you manage post-operative swelling and pain, safely regain your range of motion, and progressively rebuild your strength. This expert guidance ensures you protect the surgical repair, maximize the success of your procedure, and return to your activities safely and confidently.",
